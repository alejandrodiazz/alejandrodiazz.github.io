            <p>Hi my name is Alejandro! I am very interested in the interface between tangible circuits and programming that can be used to solve real world problems and help people. 

            <p>I just finished my undergraduate degree in 6-2 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at MIT. Last fall I took a super cool class to get comfortable in a machine shop and bringing projects to life! I have taken other project-based classes like 6.115 and 6.111 gaining know-how of electronics, PSOCs and FPGAs. I like combining cool ideas and bringing projects to life with my passion for the environment and sustainability.</p>
            <p>I am invested in the MIT Outdoors Club at MIT as well as several Sustainability clubs and initiatives including my role as a student representative to the CAAC(Climate Action Advisory Comittee)—composed of students, faculty, and staff. Furthermore, I have recently worked on research creating an evaporative vegetable cooler for use in low-income communities in Kenya. This work is done with Eric Verploegen in the MIT D-Lab.</p>
            <p>When not in the lab, I can be found in a random yoga position, 20ft high on a wall climbing, 10 miles away running, eating all the food in front of me, or maybe working...<p>
