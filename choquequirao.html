                                    <p>This trip was crazy. I wasn't that prepared, I got sick halfway, I ran out of water for a hot second, almost ran out of money... But I made it!</p>
                                    <p>The vert and distance covered was kind of crazy for two half days and 2 full days: 52.3 miles & 22,257ft of vertical gain out of the 63.5 miles and 26,834ft of vertical gain I wanted to cover</p>
                                    <p>Also got up to 15315ft on Yanama Pass!!</p>

                            <p>Started off in Cuzco picking up some provisions including cheese and bread for my dinners, with some snickers bars and gummies. In retrospect I had way too much sugary stuff, especially since I'm a sucker for savory stuff. I'm not sure what I was doing. Anyways this was my first view coming down into the valley starting at 4:20pm!</p>
                            <img src="images/adventures/choquequirao/7.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>My first stretch of the trail! A lot of downhill and honeslty a pretty solid amount of vert. I was pretty pooped when I hit the Santa Rosa camp. There were some people there, but I was too tired to talk. I paid a couple dollars to setup camp. Got in my tent, ate some bread and cheese and called it a night.</p>

                            <p>My itinerary for DAY 2. Big vert day, but mostly exploring around the Choquequirao Ruins.</p>
                            <img src="images/adventures/choquequirao/13.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>I made it to Choquequirao ruins around 10am on the second day and wow it was amazing.</p>

                            <p>I started to head off from the ruins around 3pm and saw these sick flowers. Unfortunately I ran out of water for a bit between here and the next river in about 5 miles. I banked on the river being there though and was rewarded. Thank the gods!</p>

                            <p>My itinerary for DAY 3.</p>
                            <img src="images/adventures/choquequirao/14.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>After crossing the river I jumped over a mountain in the morning. Had lunch at a person's house for a couple dollars. Amazing food honestly! Then got on and saw this amazing view as I was climbing over the tallest mountain pass on the trek.</p> 
                            <img src="images/adventures/choquequirao/9.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>Unfortunately this night I got very sick and was not having a good time. However, I powered through shivers and diarrhea and headaches to wake up and get going in the morning. I tried to finish off the rest of my itinerary DAY 4</p>
                            <img src="images/adventures/choquequirao/15.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>Long Story Short: Day 4 was a rough day. I kept an okay pace because it was mostly flat or downhill, but I had multiple moments where I felt like throwing up. I did get to cross a river using an awesome (slightly terrifying) bridge crossing contraption cage thing. But I made it!</p>
                            <p>I realized around 1/2pm that I just did not have it in me to finish. At that point I knew a small town with road access was coming up in 2 miles and those were honestly the longest miles of my life. I haggled with a small bus going to the Hydroel√©ctrica and was able to get cheaper fare than the tourists (Hell yeah). Then I got on another small van there and made it to Aguas Calientes where I just wandered around until I found the cheapest hostel possible. Which was actually super nice. </p> 
                            <p>I still felt sick unfortunately and would be sick for the next 2 weeks, but I powered ahead and still hiked up to Machu Picchu the next day despite my headaches and stomache problems. Definitely worth it though!!!!!!!!!!</p>

                            <p>This last picture is on top of Huayna Picchu. Yes I did elect to climb another 400m once I already was at Machu Picchu. Yeah I did way too much gain over the course of this trip.... worth it</p>
