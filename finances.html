                            <h3><a id="retirement">1. Saving for retirement:</a></h3>
                            <p>The two main ones are a <strong>401k</strong> and a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. A 401k is only through an employer and is normally managed without much of your input. Definitely a great idea, especially if your company matches the contributions you make.</p>

                            <p>A Roth IRA is a personal retirement account, where you take your income after tax and put it in. The reason a Roth IRA is better than a generic brokerage account is that the money is no longer taxed in the account-it grows tax free and when you pull out your money at 59.5years old you also don’t incur any taxing. I would recommend managing a Roth IRA yourself by investing in low cost funds you can drop your money in and forget about it. You can only contribute 6k to a Roth IRA every year. The first thing is to create one with a broker and then add money, normally via a linked bank account. I currently have a schwab account, because they do not have as big an impact on the environment as the other big banks and they have a nice debit card you can get. Basically it’s not the most sustainable bank, but it’s also not the worst.</p>

                            <p>Now that you have money in your Roth IRA you want to invest it. Now the game plan for a retirement account is to buy funds. Funds are an amalgamation of multiple companies under a specified category that allow the investor to minimize his risk. Essentially don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Personally I try to invest in more socially and fossil fuel industry free conscious companies so I tend to invest in what is called ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) marked funds. A few examples of the ones I’ve invested in are 
                            EMXF
                            DMXF
                            USXF</p>

                            <p>I’ve invested in these mostly because they are ESG marked, they have decent dividends, and have low management expenses. Dividends are paid usually quarterly or yearly and are a percentage of the value of your stock (you can choose to reinvest these dividends back into the underlying stock/fund if you want to-this is what I do). The management expenses are how much the company who provides this fund takes from your money. While low numbers like .1% may not sound like a lot, the numbers will add up over years and decades.</p>

                            <p>The other thing people may not know is that you can pull out the money you’ve contributed to a Roth IRA at any time without penalties (you just can’t take out the earnings on those contributions). Basically you can only take out what you out in. But this is nice if you have an emergency and need to take money out.</p>


                            <h3><a id="general_investing">2. General Investing:</a></h3>
                            <p>Now that you have a retirement account setup it’s time to start thinking about general investing. Maybe trying to invest money for use in a short term time frame or maybe these are your savings you just want to invest. If you want to continue with the broker you have that’s great. You’ll probably want to create a new regular brokerage investment account if you haven’t already and in this account you can buy funds like you did for retirement/you can be a little more speculative and risky if you want. It would be totally valid to treat this account essentially the same as the retirement account by just investing in funds and letting it ride. Personally I have a brokerage account with schwab and robinhood. Personally while robinhood isn’t the best company and has partnerships with some of the big banks for some of its programs, robinhood allowed me to get into investing easily(it has a great basic phone interface and no fees for trading). I will likely though move some money out into either schwab or somewhere else later on.</p>

                            <p>Personally I have fun researching companies and looking at the market so I’ve invested in a few companies I believe in. Though the risk is higher by investing in single stocks, the reward is also higher. With speculative stocks etc. I would recommend not venturing more than 10%, but in general don’t risk what you don’t want to lose. Also realize that having individual stocks may mean you’ll spend more time monitoring and selling/buying these positions.</p> 

                            <p>Personally my long term money is about 40% in safe plays like the funds mentioned above and some funds specifically for wind energy, solar energy, and clean energy. 40% is in maybe 15 different companies like.  And the last 20% is 10% in options and 10% in cryptocurrency (specifically Bitcoin and ethereum), but both are definitely highly speculative and a whole other conversation and I wouldn’t necessarily recommend investing in it.</p>

                            <p>The main thing for me is that I’m trying to keep some steady gains, but also try to grow the account. Some of the best gains I have made however have been in stocks that I’ve bought and just left for a year or more.  The main thing when investing is know when to cut your losses. You should really like the companies you’re investing in/think they will continue to perform well if you buy them. However if a company is doing badly, then cut them. For stocks I normally sell them if I start losing more than 10% on the investment, although sometimes it still makes sense to hold them if you think they will go up. When I first started investing I would buy things and sell them immediately when they started going down. And then I missed out on long term gains. So it’s all a trade off. With stocks though from what I’ve seen it can be a lot better to just buy and hold if you think they are good companies. You might lose with a few stocks, but the returns on the others could make up for it. For example looking at the investments I made early on, out of the 10 or so stocks I invested in just Tesla alone would have more than doubled my account and the other stocks wouldn’t have even needed to have done well. Which beyond meat would have tanked, but PLUG-a solar company-would have also done incredibly, climbing by more than 500%. But I didn’t hold all these stocks and missed out. So it’s the idea of don’t put all your eggs in one basket and you will likely do okay. But looking at myself as an example, I definitely lost money in the beginning playing around and not really having a strategy so be prepared to lose a bit especially in the beginning If you want to experiment with stocks.</p>

                            <ul class="dashed">
                              <li>Stocks go up and down, but ultimately if we take the US economy as an example, the economy will continue upwards! So many times it can be best to hold when things start dipping, because otherwise you might also miss when the economy starts going back up.</li> 
                              <li>You should always be looking at percentages! If you made 10 dollars that's cool, but what's cooler is if you're up 10% on your account or only 1%. Percentages tell a better story.</li>
                              <li>When you trade set limit orders instead of market orders, which are basically an upper or lower limit on the price of the stock you are willing to sell or buy it at. This prevents you from buying or selling at a price that you don’t want. For example if you wanted to buy a stock that’s currently at $27 I’d maybe submit a limit order to buy the stock at max $27.02. You could even set that number lower if you expect the stock to drop a bit. Otherwise you might end up paying more like $27.10. This might seem insignificant, but if you're trading small stocks worth like $.80 then ten cents is more than 10%!</li>
                              <li>Speculate with less than 10% of your account</li>
                              <li>Trends are more important than trying to find the low</li>
                              <li>Get over being wrong fast, you will never be right all the time</li>
                              <li>Be Consistent</li>
                              <li>Don’t think you are smart because you got lucky, accept responsibility for your actions</li>
