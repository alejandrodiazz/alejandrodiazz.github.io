                          <h3><a id="investment_variations">1. What can I invest in:</a></h3>
                          <p>First off are plain <strong>Stocks</strong>. These are shares of a company and by owning a share you own a piece of a company. Some companies give out dividends, but there are never management fees.</p>
                          <p>Then there are <strong>Blue-Chip Stocks</strong>. These are stocks from companies that are reputable and have withstood the test of time. Examples are IBM, Disney, & General Electric. This doesn't mean these stocks will never go down, but it does mean they should be less risky.</p>
                          <p>A more diversified investement is an <strong>ETF</strong>, which is usually actively managed and track several different underlying stocks or assets and come with a management fee and usually a dividend as well. </p>
                          <p>Then there are <strong>Mutual Funds</strong>, which are like ETFs, but they are meant specifically for long term and may come with extra fees as well as require you to invest a certain amount every time you invest. These will come with typically higher management fees and dividend yields.</p>
                          <p>Another low risk, generally for retirement account investment, is an <strong>REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)</strong>. A REIT is a company that has control over income producing real estate. Reasons to invest in REITs would be for their high dividends, long term appreciation, and to diversify your account, because they often don't correlate very much with the stock market.</p>
                          

                          <h3><a id="where_to_invest">2. Where to Invest?:</a></h3>
                          <p>The money you put in your checkings account or the companies you get your credit card from, directly benefit from your money and purchases. Because of that I have decided to close both my Vanguard and Wells Fargo Account. You can take a look here to see some of the big banks that are invested in fossil fuel for example<a target = "_blank" href="https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BOCC_2019_SUMMARY_vUS-1F.pdf">Fossil Fuel Bank Report Card 2019</a>
                          </p>
                          <p>I currently have a Schwab account, because they are more sustainable and evironmentally friendly than the other big banks and they have a nice debit card you can get. They are not the most sustainable bank, but they are also not the worst. I have both my retirement accounts, an individual brokerage account, and a checkings account with Schwab.</p>
                          <p>A large sustainable bank that is also certified B Corps is Amalgamated Bank. I plan to likely get a credit card with them. There are several other B Corps banks though. Local Credit Unions can also be a a good option as they ususally invest in the community and have good deals for their constituents.</p>
                          <p>I also have a brokerage account with Robinhood. While Robinhood isn’t the best company and has partnerships with some of the big banks for some of its programs, Robinhood allowed me to get into investing easily(it has a great, basic phone interface and no fees for trading). I will likely though move some money out into either Schwab or somewhere else later on.</p>



                          <h3><a id="retirement">3. Saving for retirement:</a></h3>
                          <p>The two main ones are a <strong>401k</strong> and a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. A 401k is only through an employer and is normally managed without much of your input. Definitely a great idea, especially if your company matches the contributions you make.</p>
                          <p>A Roth IRA is a personal retirement account, where you take your income after tax and put it in. A Roth IRA is better than a generic brokerage account because the money is not taxed in the account-it grows tax free and when you pull out your money at 59.5 years old you also don’t incur any taxing. However, you can only contribute 6k to a Roth IRA every year. I recommend personally managing your Roth IRA by investing in low cost funds/less risky investments you can drop your money in and forget about. </p>
                          <p>First create a Roth IRA w/ your broker and add money, normally via a linked bank account.</p>
                          <p>Next is investing the money in your Roth IRA. The game plan for most retirement accounts is to buy things with less risk... Funds are an amalgamation of multiple companies under a specified category that allow the investor to minimize his risk. Essentially don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Personally I try to invest in more socially and fossil fuel industry free conscious companies so I tend to invest in what are called ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) marked funds. As of Jan 2021 I am currently invested in...</p>

                          <p>I’ve invested in these mostly because they are ESG marked, they have decent dividends, and have low management expenses. However, many are relatively new and could be  risky. You can do your own research and look up similar funds by searching for ESG funds. Keep an eye for past gains, div yield and management expenses</p>
                          <p><strong>Dividends</strong> are how much money is paid out to you per year. Dividends are paid usually quarterly or yearly and are a percentage of the value of your stock (you can choose to reinvest these dividends back into the underlying stock/fund if you want to-this is what I do). 
                          <p><strong>Management Expenses</strong> are how much the company who provides this fund takes from your money per year. While low numbers like .1% may not sound like a lot, the numbers will add up over years and decades.</p>

                          <p>Remember it is key to keep adding and investing money as time goes on. If possible try to invest a minimum of 15% of your paycheck regularly</p> 

                          <p>The other thing people may not know is that you can pull out the money you’ve contributed to a Roth IRA at any time without penalties (you just can’t take out the earnings on those contributions). Basically you can only take out what you put in. This is nice if you have an emergency and need to take money out.</p>


                          <h3><a id="general_investing">4. General Investing:</a></h3>
                          <p>Time to start thinking about general investing. Generally you should have enough cash to last you ~6 months and then the rest should be invested. You can continue with your broker. Create a regular brokerage investment account if you haven’t already. In this account you can buy funds like you did for retirement and/or you can be a little more speculative and risky if you want. It would be totally valid to treat this account essentially the same as the retirement account by just investing in funds and letting it ride.</p>

                          <p>I have fun researching companies and I have invested in a few companies I believe in. Though the risk is higher by investing in single stocks, the reward is also higher. With speculative stocks etc. I would recommend not venturing more than 5% on a single stock, but in general don’t risk what you don’t want to lose. Also realize that having individual stocks may mean you’ll spend more time monitoring and selling/buying these positions.</p> 

                          <p>My own long term money as of 2021 January is about 40% in safe plays like the funds mentioned above. 40% is in maybe 15 different companies (AY, JNJ, AMAL, PLUG, NOVA, AAPL, MU, GFL, EIX, HASI, PYPL, ETSY, RIOT, STKL, CSCO, ABBV).  And the last 20% is 10% in options and 10% in cryptocurrency (specifically Bitcoin and ethereum), but both options and crypto are definitely highly speculative and a whole other conversation and I wouldn’t necessarily recommend investing in it.</p>

                          <p>The main thing for me is that I’m trying to keep some steady gains, but also try to grow the account. Some of the best gains I have made however have been in stocks that I’ve bought and just left for a year or more.  The main thing when investing is know when to cut your losses. You should really like the companies you’re investing in/think they will continue to perform well if you buy them. However if a company is doing badly, then cut them. For stocks I normally sell them if I start losing more than 10% on the investment, although sometimes it still makes sense to hold them if you think they will go up. When I first started investing I would buy things and sell them immediately when they started going down. And then I missed out on long term gains. So it’s all a trade off. With stocks though from what I’ve seen it can be a lot better to just buy and hold if you think they are good companies. You might lose with a few stocks, but the returns on the others could make up for it. For example looking at the investments I made early on, out of the 10 or so stocks I invested in just Tesla alone would have more than doubled my account and the other stocks wouldn’t have even needed to have done well. Which beyond meat would have tanked, but PLUG-a solar company-would have also done incredibly, climbing by more than 500%. But I didn’t hold all these stocks and missed out. So it’s the idea of don’t put all your eggs in one basket and you will likely do okay. But looking at myself as an example, I definitely lost money in the beginning playing around and not really having a strategy so be prepared to lose a bit especially in the beginning If you want to experiment with stocks.</p>

                          <ul class="dashed" style="text-align:left">
                            <li>Stocks go up and down, but ultimately if we take the US economy as an example, the economy will continue upwards! So many times it can be best to hold when things start dipping, because otherwise you might also miss when the economy starts going back up.</li> 
                            <li>You should always be looking at percentages! If you made 10 dollars that's cool, but what's cooler is if you're up 10% on your account or only 1%. Percentages tell a better story.</li>
                            <li>When you trade set limit orders instead of market orders, which are basically an upper or lower limit on the price of the stock you are willing to sell or buy it at. This prevents you from buying or selling at a price that you don’t want. For example if you wanted to buy a stock that’s currently at $27 I’d maybe submit a limit order to buy the stock at max $27.02. You could even set that number lower if you expect the stock to drop a bit. Otherwise you might end up paying more like $27.10. This might seem insignificant, but if you're trading small stocks worth like $.80 then ten cents is more than 10%!</li>
                            <li>Speculate with less than 10% of your account, especially in the beginning. At the very least speculate in different industries/companies</li>
                            <li>Trends are more important than trying to find the low</li>
                            <li>Get over being wrong fast, you will never be right all the time</li>
                            <li>Be Consistent</li>
                            <li>Don’t think you are smart because you got lucky, accept responsibility for your actions</li>

                            <li>Price to Book: Same as P/E, you’re looking for a smaller number. Smaller tbe better, though it’s all relative to counterparts </li>
                            <li>Dividend Growth: You just want to see that the dividend is growing consistently, higher the percent growth the better, but anything positive is good </li>
                            <li>Performance compared to benchmark and SPY: You want something that outperforms (AFTER operating expenses) SPY and other benchmarks in the industry, else you might as well own those instead </li>
                            <li>Debt to Equity: The lower the better, though some business models by default Carry higher debt, so this isn’t as important </li>
                            <li>Payout Ratio: How much of the companies profits go to its investors. The higher the number, the more the institutions give investors, but also the LESS they are reinvesting into the company, which can lead to minimal appreciation and growth. So keep that in mind... try to pick something in the middle, 20-30% range, but higher or lower is fine. Again depends on all the other factors and the industry and business model</li>
                            <li>Morning Star Rating or other ratings: Ratings are entirely unnecessary, but to have all your criteria met AND see that your pick has a decent (4-5 star) rating, just adds to conviction </li>
