                            <p>Packing up in the morning to leave after having to wait an hour for the neighbor to move his car ;) Anyways we got going and you know covidâ€“had to ride with our car doors down and our masks on.</p>

                            <p>We set up and were all taking turns on this sick boulder- The Wave V2</p>

                            <p>Emma took a turn and killed it. Such a hype video honestly and she was killing the game the entire day.</p>

                            <p>Taco took a turn and had some really good leg engagement and heel hooks that I definitely took note of to help me send!</p>

                            <p>Isaac's turn on the wave, trying to make the move across. Definitely the crux of the boulder. </p>

                            <p>Carlos just always decided to mantle without using his feet for some reason. We told him otherwise, but he said, "You don't know me." I guess we don't. He was a crack up.</p>

                            <p>Taco took a turn on a move on the Ship's Prow and Emma got some sick pictures.</p> 
                            <img src="images/adventures/lincolnwoods20/IMG_5787.JPG" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>Charles got on a similar one on Ship's Prow and was dialed in.</p>
                            <img src="images/adventures/lincolnwoods20/IMG_5789.JPG" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>We all tried the upside down beta on this one, but it was rough and felt pretty scary, not sure that was the smartest move. It was fun to try though. Projecting with friends is the best.</p>
                            <img src="images/adventures/lincolnwoods20/upsidedown.JPG" alt=""><br><br>

                            <p>Then we all tried this one where we had to get inside this big pocket and then shimmy our way out. Honestly pretty tough, but a sick V3 to send!!!!!!!!</p>
                            <img src="images/adventures/lincolnwoods20/IMG_5791.JPG" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>Super fun day with the squad. We'll have to come out again!!!</p>
